#### Overview
This is a game where the player drives around a BB8 model drives around a small chicago-themed yard and gently tosses "pizza" bullets (with control/click) in order to feed the feral cats that live in my yard.   The player gets points when a pizza bullet hits an unused plate, which then turns into a pizza, and loses points when they hit a cat (the cats are skittish).  2 cat collisions restarts the game.

#### Requirements (In Order)

 - BB8 is always visible
 - Ground is present with a grass texture, trees, and cats
 - Two colored point light sources are located near the wall with the image of the beach
 - 5 "plates" are present that you give you points and change color (to pizza texture) when they collide with a projectile.
 - Player does not slide/fall when projectiles are fired (but does collide with trees/walls)
 - Pizza Bullets collide with ground/trees/walls/plates that have been scored with (cats dissapear).
 - There are 4 walls around the edge of the map 
 - The player recieves points when the pizza bullets hit plates (the first time).
 - Points are shown in the bottom right corner.
 - 3D objects: BB8, pizza bullets, trees, cats
 - 2D textures: grass, tree bark, pizza (?), wall images.
